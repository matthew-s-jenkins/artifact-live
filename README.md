## 🎯 About the Project

**Artifact Live** is a full-stack business operations platform designed to run multiple small businesses from a single codebase. Each business gets its own workflow and UI, but shares a battle-tested core: double-entry accounting, FIFO inventory costing, and proper financial tracking.

### Why I Built This

I run multiple side businesses - custom keyboard builds, electronics projects, computer refurbishment. Each has different workflows but the same underlying need: know what inventory I have, what it cost, and whether I'm making money.

Most inventory apps are either too simple (spreadsheets with no accounting) or too complex (enterprise ERP systems). I needed something in between: real accounting principles wrapped in business-specific interfaces.

The solution: build a core engine once, then wrap it for each business type. The keyboard business gets a BOM builder. The computer shop gets a part-out workflow. Same foundation, different faces.

### What It Does

- **Multi-business isolation** - Each business has its own projects, states, and workflows
- **Shared inventory model** - Parts exist in a catalog, allocated to specific projects
- **Real FIFO costing** - Know the actual cost of goods sold, not averages
- **Double-entry accounting** - Every transaction balances, every dollar is tracked
- **Portable deployment** - SQLite database means you can hand someone a folder

### Part of a Larger System

Artifact Live is the third piece of a connected accounting ecosystem:

| Project | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| [Perfect Books](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/perfect-books) | Personal finance management | In daily use |
| [Digital Harvest](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/digital-harvest-sim) | Business simulation / learning sandbox | Complete |
| **Artifact Live** | Real business operations | Active development |

The progression:
- **Perfect Books** proved the accounting patterns work for real money
- **Digital Harvest** stress-tested inventory + accounting at scale (simulated)
- **Artifact Live** applies both to real business operations

All three share the same core architecture: Flask API, React frontend, SQLite database, double-entry ledger.

## ✨ Core Features

### 📦 Inventory Management

- **Parts Catalog** - Reusable catalog entries with categories, default prices, weight classes
- **Quantity Tracking** - Track bulk items (90 switches) not just individual parts
- **Mystery Parts** - Placeholder entries for unidentified parts, identify later
- **Metadata Support** - Flexible JSON fields for switch mods (lubed, filmed, spring-swapped)
- **Availability Breakdown** - See Total | Available | In Projects (For Sale vs Personal)

### 🔧 Project Management

- **Business-Specific Statuses** - CCS: ACQUIRED → PARTING → SOLD, Keyboards: PLANNED → ASSEMBLED → DEPLOYED
- **For Sale Flag** - Distinguish builds for sale vs personal use
- **Part Allocation** - Assign inventory to projects with over-allocation prevention
- **Partial Allocation** - Allocate 67 of 90 switches, leaving 23 in inventory

### 📊 Build Planning

- **Availability Analysis** - See what's available, what needs sourcing, what requires disassembly
- **Disassembly Suggestions** - "Need to disassemble Keyboard X to get Y switches"
- **Staged Mode** - Plan a build without committing parts
- **Confirm/Cancel** - Commit staged parts or return to inventory

### 🔄 Disassembly Workflow

- **Return Parts to Inventory** - Disassemble a build, parts go back to loose inventory
- **Consumables Handling** - Foam, lube, tape marked as destroyed (TRASHED)
- **Mystery Identification** - Identify unknown parts during disassembly

### 📈 Dashboard

- **At-a-Glance View** - Total parts by category, available vs allocated
- **Project Status** - Quick counts by status, recent projects list
- **Quick Filters** - For Sale, Personal, In Progress

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Architecture

- **API-first design** - Flask REST API with clean separation from frontend
- **Business isolation via subsection_id** - Single database, complete data separation
- **Wrapper pattern** - Core engine handles accounting/inventory, business modules handle workflows

### Accounting Engine

- **Double-entry ledger** - Every transaction creates balanced DR/CR entries
- **FIFO inventory costing** - Accurate COGS calculation, not averages
- **Immutable audit trail** - Transactions are reversed, never deleted
- **Transaction UUIDs** - Group related entries for atomic operations

### Why SQLite

- **Portable** - Entire app is one folder, no database server
- **Distributable** - Can deploy to clients by copying files
- **Scalable path** - PostgreSQL migration ready when concurrent access is needed

- ✅ Phase 1.0: Foundation - Schema, statuses, bidirectional flow
- ✅ Phase 1.1: Parts Catalog - CRUD, categories, mystery parts
- ✅ Phase 1.2: Project Management - Statuses, for_sale flag
- ✅ Phase 1.3: Part Allocation - Partial quantities, staged mode
- ✅ Phase 1.4: Disassembly Workflow - Return parts, handle consumables
- ✅ Phase 1.5: Build Planning - Availability analysis, disassembly suggestions
- ✅ Phase 1.6: Dashboard - At-a-glance inventory and project status
- 🔜 Phase 2.0: BOM Templates - Save and reuse build configurations
- 🔜 Phase 2.1: Financial Integration - Cost tracking, profitability

### Stage 2: First Client

Deploy to Family Electric. Get real feedback from a real business user.

### Stage 3: Revenue

Monthly hosting/support fee from clients. Recurring revenue from the platform.

### Stage 4: Scale

- PostgreSQL migration for concurrent multi-user access
- Cloud deployment for mobile/field access
- Additional business wrappers as client needs emerge

**The Goal:** Software that runs businesses. Financial independence through recurring revenue from small business clients who need real inventory tracking without enterprise complexity.

| [Perfect Books](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/perfect-books) | Public | Personal double-entry accounting |
| [Digital Harvest](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/digital-harvest-sim) | Public | Business simulation & analytics platform |
| **Canopy** | Private (built at Harris Teeter) | Executive sales intelligence dashboard |
| **Cadence** | Private (built at Harris Teeter) | Close management & account ownership platform |

Artifact Live is the **operations branch** of the platform — inventory, projects, labor, and material tracking. It reads from and writes to the same double-entry ledger that powers [Perfect Books](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/perfect-books), and the patterns were stress-tested at scale in [Digital Harvest](https://github.com/matthew-s-jenkins/digital-harvest-sim) before being applied to real business operations. Canopy and Cadence bring reporting and close management to enterprise retail using the same architecture.

**Shared principles:**
- ✅ Double-entry accounting (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
- ✅ Immutable financial ledger with transaction UUIDs
- ✅ SQLite database with full portability
- ✅ Flask REST API architecture
- ✅ React + Tailwind CSS frontend
